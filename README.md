# Overview of Analysis 

For this project, our analysis digs deeper into the temperature trends; specifically, temperature data for months of June and December in Oahu. We will determine the summary stats for June and December by using Python, Pandas functions and methods and SQLAlchemy. Our dataset pertaining to weather conditions has been stored in an SQLite database. SQLAlchemy is used to connect as well as generate queries to pull the information we need to further deepen our analysis. 

## Results 

From our results, we've created DataFrames where temperatures in June and December are added onto a list. The summary of the statistics generated for the DataFrame is shown down below in Figures 1 and 2:

From our DataFrames and their corresponding graphs, we can conclude:

- June and December showcase similar minimum, maximum and average temps 
- The average temperature for both months is between 72-75 degrees F
- Seems the temperature stays pretty consistent year round based on our dataset
