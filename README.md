# Overview of Analysis 

For this project, our analysis digs deeper into the temperature trends; specifically, temperature data for months of June and December in Oahu. We will determine the summary stats for June and December by using Python, Pandas functions and methods and SQLAlchemy. Our dataset pertaining to weather conditions has been stored in an SQLite database. SQLAlchemy is used to connect as well as generate queries to pull the information we need to further deepen our analysis.
